								<p>Hi there! My name is Manu Karthik Maddali. Welcome to my website!</p>
								<p>4 years ago I was graduating high school, keen on becoming a gastroenterologist. So much, that my senior project was based on it!</p>
								<p>But that summer before college changed everything. I wanted to see what my backup plan would be in case this failed, so I learned about Computer Science. I was always interested in CS, but never thought I would get so deep into it. Boy did I! By the end of summer I was so into it that I decided to switch to CS completely. Even though it was my passion, I never found it comforting to learn it in class. So I decided I would learn it by myself. That started my passion for CS and self-teaching.</p>
								<p> My first language I learned was Python, and I fell in love with it. So versatile and flexible, I didn't know how to use it. That is, until, I came across Data Science. I knew I have the tools to excel in it and took up many online courses to master it. Which I did in a year. But that still wasn't enough. I was hungry for more. Side projects did not do a good job on satisfying my need to learn more. I NEEDED real world experinece where I solved REAL problems. So, I decided to get an internship in Data Science.<p>
								<p> After appling to over 120+ internships, 4 interviews, I landed a job as a Data Analyst Intern for a supply chain company (I was the only Data Analyst for the whole company, crazy right?). At my internship, I found a problem that my department faced, and I realized I could solve it with Python. After 2 months I came out with an MVP for that product and implemented it to use for our department. As August came, I knew my internship was coming to an end, but to my suprise the CFO decided to extend it till October! I worked there until October and bid farewell to the company that taught me a lot and allowed me to excel in every way possible.
								<p> Then came 2020... After our classes went online, I headed back home to my parents and realized I had so much free time. I wanted to learn a new skill. App Developement was really interesting. I learned Swift and Xcode in a span of two month and built a few simple apps to showcase it.
								<p> I hope this was enough to give you a good idea on what my skills and mind set are.
								<p> Need to know more? Let's grab a cup of coffee, or better yet, get on a Zoom call!
								<p> Thank you for visiting my site!<p>
