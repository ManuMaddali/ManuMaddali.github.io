								<p>Hi there! My name is Manu Karthik Maddali. Welcome to my website!</p>
								<p>4 years ago I was graduating high school, keen on becoming a gastroenterologist. So much, that my senior project was based on it!</p>
								<p>But that summer before college changed everything. I wanted to see what my backup plan could be in case my current one didn’t pan out, so I decided to look into Computer Science. I was always interested in CS but never thought that I would get so deep into it. Boy did I! By the end of summer, I was so dedicated that I decided to pursue CS wholeheartedly. Even though it was my passion, I never found it comforting to learn it in class. Thus, I began my journey of self-teaching.</p>
								<p> The first language I taught myself was Python, and I fell in love with it. So versatile and flexible, yet I didn't know how to put it to good use. That is, until, I came across Data Science. I knew I had the tools to excel in it and took up many online courses to master it. Which I accomplished in a year. But that still wasn't enough. I was hungry for more. Independent side projects weren’t satisfying my need to learn anymore. I NEEDED real-world experience where I solved REAL problems. So, I decided to get an internship in Data Science.<p>
								<p> 120+ internships and 4 interviews later, I landed a job as a Data Analyst Intern for a supply chain company (I was the only Data Analyst for the entire company, crazy right?). At my internship, I found a problem that my department faced, and I realized I could solve it using Python. After 2 months I came out with an MVP for that product and implemented it to use for our department. As August neared, I knew my internship was coming to an end, but to my surprise, the CFO decided to extend it till October! I worked there until October and bid farewell to the company that taught me so much and allowed me to grow and excel in every way possible.<p>
								<p> Then came 2020... After our classes went online, I headed back home to my parents and realized I had so much free time. I wanted to learn a new skill. App Development caught my eye. I learned Swift and Xcode in a span of two months and built a few simple apps to showcase it.<p>
								<p> I hope this little life story gave you a good idea of what my skills and mindset consist of.<p>
								<p> Want to know more? Let's get on a Zoom call, or better yet, grab a cup of coffee!<p>
								<p> Thank you for visiting my site!<p>
